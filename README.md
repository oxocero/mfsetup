# mfsetup
This is intended to be a simple setup file to help me setup a quick and dirty development server.
###yos
Download the installer script
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxocero/mfsetup/master/yosa.sh
```

Make it executable
```bash
chmod +x yosa.sh
```

Run it! Give it some minutes to perform all the tasks. And yes, you can thank me later :)
```bash
sudo ./yosa.sh
```
